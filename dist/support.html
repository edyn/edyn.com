Just plant the solar-powered sensor in your garden to continuously monitor environmental conditions. The device connects to your Wi-Fi network and sends you valuable insights to your phone in near real time.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Continuous monitoring: </strong>Edyn tracks moisture, light, temperature, humidity, and soil nutrition.</li> <li><strong>Real-time guidance: </strong>Get tailored tips and notifications based on your garden’s conditions and the weather forecast.</li> <li><strong>Garden diagnostics: </strong>Edyn analyzes your garden to discover which plants will grow best given your specific conditions and climate.</li> <li><strong>Plant database: </strong>Discover new plants with Edyn's database of plants.</li> <li><strong>Wi-Fi connected: </strong>Monitor your garden from anywhere.</li> </ul> <h5>What does the Edyn Garden Sensor measure?</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Soil Moisture</strong> <p><br>Your Edyn Garden Sensor reports soil moisture in units of percent volume of water (volumetric water content, or % vwc). The full volume of your soil (100%) is broken down into the solid soil particles and roots (usually 50-75%), air (pore space), and the liquid water that coats the soil particles and fills the air space. That means that fully saturated soil will never reach 100% -- that would mean all of the soil and roots and air have also been displaced! At maximum field water capacity (the condition when all void spaces are filled with water), a 40-50% vwc measurement is typical.<br><br>The Edyn Garden Sensor has been calibrated to take into account the ways soils interact with the charged surface of the sensor tip, so placing your sensor in a glass of water will not yield values of 100%. The sensor stem sends out a series of very mild electrical pulses to the soil every 10 minutes, and measures changes to those pulse over time. Different patterns in pulse response are then separated into a soil nutrient reading (described below), and a volumetric soil moisture reading using Edyn’s proprietary algorithms.<br><br>Additional information on Soil Water Content can be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_content>found here</a>.</p> </li> <li><strong>Light</strong> <p><br>The Edyn Garden Sensor measures light as a voltage through the solar panel that powers your sensor. We convert this voltage to the unit lux (luminosity), which is a more common way of looking at light levels for plants. In some places, light levels get so high that they can scorch plants (observable when parts of the leaves turn a crispy yellow color, then quickly die back). Being able to track light levels can be very helpful in deciding whether it is time to put up shade cloth. Historical light level readings are also used by Edyn to power the garden composition suggestion engine.</p> </li> <li><strong>Temperature</strong> <p><br>The temperature readings from the Edyn sensor are much more localized than local forecasts, which typically measure air temperature several meters above the ground. Bare soil and direct sun can lead to a garden experiencing temperatures much higher than the local forecast would suggest. Placement relative to walls, trees, etc. that shade your garden can also lead to temperatures which are significantly different from the local weather forecast. High temperatures can result in increased water loss to the atmosphere, and knowing how temperature, light levels, and humidity combine in your garden can help inform localized drought predictions for your garden. Mulching and planting shade trees are two natural ways to lower garden temperatures to protect gardens if you live in a hot environment.</p> </li> <li><strong>Humidity</strong> <p><br>Humidity is sometimes an under-appreciated variable for gardeners. Every time a leaf opens its pores to pull in carbon dioxide, it also releases moisture back into the atmosphere. When the humidity is very low (when it’s hot and dry), a lot of moisture can be lost through evapotranspiration (ET). This increases the likelihood of daytime wilting, even when the plants are regularly getting water. Humidity is lowest in full-sun, therefore, high light levels and temperatures have an influence on the humidity that your plants experience.<br><br>There are two types of wilting to consider. The first is from general drought stress, where the plant is under such dry soil conditions that it can no longer maintain rigid cell structure and internal support. The second is daytime drooping of leaves from very dry air; this is an adaptive mechanism that many plants have to reduce their exposure to the drying sun and dry air (the pores of droopy leaves don’t let out as much moisture through ET). If your plants don’t naturally regain rigidity in the evenings, they risk chronic dry-soil induced wilting. If your plants are able to recover in the evening without additional water, then they may simply need shading for more optimal performance, reducing the drying and heating influence of mid-day sunlight. </p> </li> <li><strong>Soil Nutrition</strong> <p><br>The Edyn Garden Sensor nutrition reading comes from the electrical conductivity of your soil. Electrical conductivity is a wholistic way of looking at the nutrient status of your soil and is a result of the cation exchange capacity (CEC), carbon content, and physical properties (drainage, pore space, and soil type among others) of your soil. The majority of the nutrients that your plants require for optimum growth are in the form of cations and anions, and your plants’ ability to access these nutrients are related to the above soil properties. For this reason, your Edyn sensor does not give you measurements of specific nutrients in your soil, but instead, a measure of relative soil condition required for ideal nutrient delivery. Some soils naturally have a higher electrical conductivity, such as clays, and others particularly low, such as quartz sands. We are continually working to develop models to account for soil heterogeneity, but many edge cases remain. Amending your garden soil with compost, naturally rich in carbon and nutrients, is one way to bring soil nutrient status up if you are in one of those sandy soils, or heterogeneous edge cases.<br><br>Additional information on Soil Chemistry can be <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil#Soil_chemistry>found here</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <a id=about-valves href=# class=anchor></a> <h4>Edyn Water Valve</h4><br> <h5>What is the Edyn Water Valve?</h5> <p>The Edyn Water Valve tailors irrigation events to match your gardens’ needs. The valve automatically controls your existing irrigation system based on the local weather forecast and the plants you have in your garden, if used as a stand alone system. If you choose to link an Edyn Water Valve to the Edyn Garden Sensor, the data feed from your sensor can be used to inform Smart Watering (below). The valve connects to your Wi-Fi network so you can control it from anywhere using your smartphone and the Edyn app. Save water, lower your utility bills, and never worry about thirsty plants again.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Smart watering: </strong>Edyn waters your plants based on the weather and the readings from your Edyn Garden Sensor. No more running your sprinklers in the rain. </li> <li><strong>Manual watering: </strong>Design your own watering schedule to meet your specialized needs. This function does not require an Edyn Garden Sensor. Efficiently manage your water usage. Set the time of day and maximum duration using your smartphone.</li> <li><strong>Wi-Fi connected: </strong>Easily control your Water Valve through your phone. Stay connected to your garden from anywhere.</li> <li><strong>Made to live outdoors, just like plants: </strong>The Edyn Water Valve is resistant to sun, rain, moisture, common fertilizers, and pesticides. The rechargeable battery is solar-powered.</li> <li><strong>Monitor real-time conditions: </strong>Add the Edyn Garden Sensor to continuously monitor environmental conditions in your garden, including soil moisture.</li> </ul> <p>The Edyn Water Valve will work with any drip irrigation, soaker hose or sprinkler system with a standard United States garden hose thread (GHT). Edyn also works with most washing machine spigots (an adapter may be necessary). The internal solenoid of the Water Valve requires at least 5 PSI (35 kPa) of pressure to activate, therefore, it may not be suitable for ground-level water-barrel watering systems.</p> <h5>Features</h5> <ul> <li><strong>Smart Watering</strong> <p><br>Edyn Smart Watering can be enabled when you have an Edyn Garden Sensor paired to the Edyn Water Valve. Using temperature and humidity measurements from the Edyn Garden Sensor, the Smart Watering algorithm first calculates how much water demand there is due to climate (evaporation) and plant water demand (Potential Evapotranspiration, or PET). This can be thought of as an approximation for how much water would need to be applied to your garden in order to keep it exactly as it is. Baseline Smart Watering duration and frequency are a function of garden specific PET replacement calculations and the amount of water required to result in net zero water loss, the ‘ideal moisture level’. The smart algorithm then calculates how far your soil moisture is from the ‘ideal’ and uses that, in combination with your irrigation system type, to determine how your garden needs to be watered to achieve ideal conditions. If your soil moisture is over target (i.e., plenty wet!) the next watering that would normally happen according to the smart schedule for your garden will be skipped.<br><br>Under most climatic conditions, watering occurs three times per week. Watering events will be skipped because of a 70% chance of rain that day (see Rain Skipping) or because the soil moisture is already at or above ideal conditions (in smart watering mode). In the event of very hot and dry conditions, sensor data will inform the Smart Watering system that a daily - or even twice daily - watering is required to maintain PET replacement and ideal moisture levels.</p> </li> <li><strong>Rain Skipping</strong> <p><br>The Edyn Rain Skipping system uses a weather forecast API to determine if scheduled waterings are unnecessary given rain events. If you have enabled Rain Skipping, and have set a Manual Watering schedule, any scheduled watering events for the day will be automatically cancelled if there is a 50%, or greater, chance of rain at 12 pm (midnight) the day of scheduled waterings. </p> </li> <li><strong>Upcoming features</strong> <p><br>The current configuration makes assumptions about the flow rate from your irrigation system. Upcoming changes to the app will allow you to customize your flow rate to match your irrigation system more exactly!</p> </li> </ul> <a id=device-compatibility href=# class=anchor></a> <h4>Device compatibility</h4> <ul> <li><strong>iOS</strong> <p><br>We support the following Apple devices running iOS 9 or higher: <ul> <li>iPhone 5, 5s, 6, 6 Plus, and iPod Touch</li> </ul> </p> <p><br>The app is designed for iPhone and iPod Touch - technically, it will work on iPads as well, but we can't officially support all features working correctly on them at this time.</p> </li> <li><strong>Android</strong> <p><br>If your device uses JellyBean (4.1) or above, there is a very good chance that Edyn will work on your mobile device. We have tested it on popular Android phone models and are constantly testing on more devices.<br><br>The app is designed for Android mobile devices - technically, it will work on tablets as well, but we can't officially support all features working correctly on them at this time.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Edyn devices use Electric Imp’s BlinkUp technology in order to connect your devices to Wi-Fi.

The BlinkUp reader needs high contrast, so we recommend that you are in a darkened room (or that you perform blink-up under a table), and that your phone is completely flush with the reader. Light leaking can cause Wi-Fi sync (Step 1) failure. It’s also helpful to have audio enabled on your mobile device during blink-up as beeping indicates when BlinkUp is initiated and completed.</p> <ul> <li>When you turn on your Garden Sensor, it will immediately enter into pairing mode.</li> <li>To preserve battery, your device will only remain in pairing mode for 90 seconds. To re-enter pairing mode, give the power button a short press.</li> <li>The app will walk you through the pairing process with illustrations. Make sure you have your Wi-Fi password ready.</li> <li>To re-connect your sensor to a new Wi-Fi network, click "add device" and then go through regular BlinkUp as if it were the first time pairing this sensor.</li> </ul> <p>The Wi-Fi connection requires a 2.4 GHz network. If you have a 5Ghz network, we recommend creating a separate 2.4 GHz network with a unique SSID, and then pairing your Edyn device to that network.</p> <p><strong>Power button</strong></p> <ul> <li>Turn your Edyn device on with a short press (~ 1 second) of the power button.</li> <li>Turn your Edyn device off with a long press (~ 4 seconds) of the power button.</li> <li>Enter into pairing mode with a short press of the power button.</li> <li>Check battery status using the Edyn app.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Light signal</strong></p> <ul> <li>To preserve battery, your Edyn device will only show a light signal when it needs to communicate information. A short press of the power button will turn on the light signal for a few minutes.</li> <li><strong>Solid white</strong> = device is in pairing mode</li> <li><strong>Flashing amber</strong> = device is in pairing mode</li> <li><strong>Solid green</strong> = successful blinkup or installing software updates</li> <li><strong>Flashing green</strong> = connected to Wi-Fi</li> <li><strong>Flashing red (after normal operation)</strong> = device lost connection</li> <li><strong>Flashing red (after pairing)</strong> = pairing unsuccessful (due to incorrect network name (case sensitive), incorrect network password, etc.) (Note that there will be a series with other red flashes during the connection process - a persistently flashing red light signals that it failed to connect.)</li> <li>If you never saw flashing green during Step 1 of the pairing process (light continued to be a solid white light) then there was a light leak during the BlinkUp process. Repeat the process, ensuring that the phone is flush with the light reader, minimizing the possibility of external light leaking in.</li> </ul> <p><strong>If you have difficulties with this step</strong> </p><p>Although rare, occasionally a battery is depleted before it arrives to your home. If lights fail to blink when you turn the device on, leave it in the sun for 1-2 days to ensure the battery is fully charged.</p> <p></p><br> <a id=care-for-device href=# class=anchor></a> <h4>Care for your Edyn device</h4> <ul> <li>Use water and a soft, non-abrasive cloth to clean your Edyn device. If you have hard water, we recommend isopropyl alcohol or bottled water for cleaning the solar panel and sensor shaft.</li> <li>Be careful not to drop your sensor or scratch the top solar panel surface with a sharp or heavy object. Scratches to the solar panel could impact its ability to charge.</li> <li>Although your Edyn device is water resistant, please don’t submerge it completely under water.</li> <li>Do not expose your Edyn device to temperatures below 32ºF (0ºC) or above 120ºF (48ºC). When temperatures drop to freezing, bring your Edyn devices indoors.</li> <li>Be careful not to scratch the solar panel surface. Scratches will impact its ability to charge.</li> <li>Do not attempt to repair, modify, or disassemble your Edyn device. Doing so will violate your warranty. If you believe something is wrong with your Edyn device please contact us at <a href=mailto:support@edyn.com>support@edyn.com </a>for help troubleshooting. </li> <li>Product Disposal: Please dispose of your product and packaging in accordance with local regulations. Do not dispose of your Edyn device with regular household waste.</li> </ul> <a id=remove-or-make-changes href=# class=anchor></a> <h4>Remove or make changes to your Edyn device</h4><br> <p><strong>How to change things</strong><br><a href=https://edyn.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204926619 target=_blank>Change Wi-Fi routers</a></p> <p><strong>How to delete things</strong><br><a href=https://edyn.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205192415 target=_blank>Turn off / remove from your wireless network</a><br><a href=https://edyn.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210761726 target=_blank>Delete a device from your gardens in the app</a></p> <a id=getting-started href=# class=anchor></a> <h3>Getting started</h3> <a id=getting-started-sensor href=# class=anchor></a> <h4>Edyn Garden Sensor</h4><br> <p><strong>Installing your sensor</strong> <ul> <li>Our Wi-Fi chip and antenna are rated for up to 300 feet from your router. We have successfully received and transmitted data at a distance of 2,500 feet with unobstructed line of sight. If your router is farther from your garden, we recommend using a Wi-Fi repeater or extender.</li> <li>If this is your first time using the Sensor, make sure it is inserted into a well-packed area of soil. Wet the soil with ~1 gallon (3.7L) of water and wait 5 minutes before inserting the sensor with a single downward motion so that less than 1" of metal shaft remains above ground. Due to heterogeneity in the soil, you may have to try a second location to make sure your Garden Sensor was not installed next to a rock or root ball.</li> <li>Location </li> <ul> <li>There is a bit of an art to perfectly placing the sensor in relation to your plants, irrigation sources, and ensuring it gets enough light. You may have to experiment a bit to get the right placement for your garden.</li> <li>Find a spot with average conditions for the area you plan to monitor.</li> <li>Your sensor’s Wi-Fi chip works best up to 300 ft from your router. Good line of sight from the router will increase the Wi-Fi range.</li> <li>Make sure your sensor receives enough sunlight for solar charging. Your sensor does best with 10+ hours of full sun.</li> <li>Placement under taller plants is not recommended for two reasons: The shade will prevent the solar panel from recharging the battery and roots, or roots may interfere with the soil sensor, leading to improbably low soil moisture measurements. Shade may also prevent the sensor from getting accurate light readings for your garden.</li> <li>If you are placing a sensor in a garden without an irrigation source, then we recommend placing the sensor in the location that best represents specific interests you have; near delicate plants that require more attention or in a sprouting vegetable patch are two such examples.</li> <li>If you are using your sensor along with an irrigation source (or linked to the Edyn Water Valve), then your selected irrigation type and device placement matters a great deal. </li> <ul> <li>Soaker hoses and drip lines usually have a manufacturing-recommended watering range of 1 foot (30 cm) around the hose (soil specifics would mean you should increase or decrease that range). We recommend placing the sensor within that range. Our own tests have shown very similar soil readings within this range.</li> <li>Sprinkler systems vary a great deal, so we recommend placing the sensor within the footprint of your sprinkler system.</li> <li>Avoid installing the Edyn Garden Sensor in locations (such as depressions) that puddle during irrigation events.</li> </ul> </ul> </ul> </p><p>Note that it may take up to 2 hours for your garden to collect enough data to show up on your device graphs in the app. </p> <p></p> <p><strong>Ongoing</strong><br>Water flow down the main Edyn Garden Sensor stem, general soil settling, and getting blocked by growing roots or root induced soil desiccation and cracking can all cause readings to reduce in quality over time. We recommend re-inserting your Garden Sensor every couple of months, or as needed. When you remove the sensor from the soil, wipe off the sensor with a damp paper towel. If you see any corrosion on the tip of the sensor, clean it off with isopropyl alcohol. When re-planting the sensor, choose a nearby location and wet the soil with 1 gallon of water. Wait 5 minutes before inserting the sensor with a single downward motion so that less than 1" of metal remains above ground.<br><br>Your Garden Sensor is powered by a rechargeable LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (lithium iron phosphate) battery that lasts up to 7 years and is charged by solar energy. We recommend making sure your battery stays charged above 50%. You can check your device’s battery level in the Edyn app under “My gardens” -> [name of your garden]</p> <a id=getting-started-valve href=# class=anchor></a> <h4>Edyn Water Valve</h4><br> <p><strong>Installing your valve</strong> </p><p>Our Wi-Fi chip is rated for 300 feet from your router. We have successfully received and transmitted data at a distance of 2,500 feet with an unobstructed line of sight. If your router is farther from your garden, we recommend using a Wi-Fi repeater or extender.</p> <ul> <li>Your Water Valve works with most irrigation systems by attaching to the main garden hose. We recommend attaching the valve between the hose leading to your garden and the irrigation line. For many gardens this may mean using a short extension hose between the valve and the spigot. <strong>Note: </strong>The valve can not be directly applied to the spigot. The angle of most hose faucets will cause too much water pressure and the valve may leak or crack under pressure. Further, the solar panel needs direct light, and must be upright with the solar panel always facing up. We provide a stake to place on the female end of the valve in order to maintain proper orientation to the sun. </li> <li>If you have a UK- or British-style hose/tap, <a href=https://edyn.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/209981406-How-do-I-connect-the-Edyn-Water-Valve-to-a-UK-or-British-Style-Garden-Hose-or-Hose-Tap- target=_blank>click here</a> for additional instructions.</li> <li>Make sure the hose faucet (spigot) is turned on, and remains so. If you use your faucet for multiple applications, we recommend using a splitter at the faucet. </li> <li>We provide an immediate watering test to ensure the valve is working. Pressing the pairing button three times in rapid succession will open up the valve. A single press will close the valve again.</li> <li>If you are pairing your valve with a sensor:</li> <ul> <li>Open the Edyn app.</li> <li>Navigate to Settings (three horizontal lines in the nav bar)</li> <li>Tap 'Add Device'</li> <li>Select 'Water Valve'</li> <li>Select the name of your Edyn Garden Sensor</li> <li>Tap 'Continue'</li> <li>Follow the prompts on screen.</li> </ul> <li>In general, if your Edyn Water Valve in Smart mode is providing your garden with more water than is ideal, moving the sensor closer to the irrigation source is recommended. Similarly, if your Edyn Water Valve in smart mode is watering less than is ideal, your Edyn Garden Sensor may be too close to the irrigation source and so reading only the wettest part of your garden soils. Please read more about ideal sensor placement under the Edyn Garden Sensor section of the FAQ.</li> </ul> <p>How to set an irrigation schedule</p> <ul> <li>Your valve information and schedules can be accessed by tapping on the droplet on the front of your garden screen in the app.</li> <li>At the upper right of your screen there are three parallel lines.

You can now add a single watering event under the schedule editor. Tap the screen where it says “Add one-time watering”.</li> <li>This will bring you to a screen that will allow you to scroll through upcoming dates, the time you want the event to occur, and the length of the watering. You will not be able to schedule a watering sooner than a half hour from that moment; your valve needs to have time to check in and receive instructions. Scheduling a watering too soon will result in a pop-up warning.</li> <li>Be sure to tap “Save” in the upper right corner.</li> </ul> <li>View your past watering events <ul> <li>Click on “Past waterings” on the bottom of the main valve screen to view your recent valve history.

As a result, a watering event scheduled fewer than 21 minutes in the future may not be executed. We recommend giving the valve a 30 minute window to ensure instructions are received for both recurring schedules and one-time waterings. Attempting to schedule a watering too soon will result in a pop-up warning.</p> <p><strong>Wi-Fi</strong><br>If your Wi-Fi has connectivity problems, there is a chance your valve may not receive scheduled events. It is important to make sure your Wi-Fi maintains good strength and connectivity. If you have any concerns about your connectivity, please contact Edyn support and we can assist in diagnosing your Wi-Fi strength.<br><br>Wi-Fi signal strength in the garden can be improved several ways: <ul> <li>Move the router and the Edyn device closer together. Wi-Fi signal decreases exponentially with distance, so moving your device even a few feet closer to the router can have a significant effect.</li> <li>Remove obstructions between the router and Edyn device. Large, dense objects decrease Wi-Fi signal strength. By removing them from the path between your router and Edyn device, you can improve the signal significantly.</li> <li>Deploy a Wi-Fi repeater/extender. Wi-Fi repeaters boost the signal from your main router. By deploying one in the garden, you can improve your Wi-Fi signal strength and enjoy Wi-Fi throughout your garden. We recommend this particular model for its performance, small size, and affordable price.</li> </ul> </p> <p></p> <p><strong>Batteries</strong><br>Your Edyn Water Valve is powered by a rechargeable LiFePO4 (lithium iron phosphate) battery that lasts up to 7 years and is charged by solar energy. We recommend making sure your battery stays charged above 50%. You can check your device’s battery level in the Edyn app under “My gardens” -> [name of your garden]</p><br> <a id=faq href=# class=anchor></a> <h3>Commonly asked support questions</h3> <p><a href=https://edyn.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210819603-My-Edyn-Device-won-t-connect-to-my-Wi-Fi-Help- target=_blank>I can’t get my device to sync to the Wi-Fi.
